#Movie Recommendation System

This project aims to provide you with a personalized movie recommendation experience based on your preferences. Whether you're a film buff or just looking for something to watch, our system will help you discover new movies that align with your interests.

The Content-Based Movie Recommender System uses content-based filtering, which involves matching movies based on their attributes and features. By understanding the characteristics of movies you like, it suggests similar movies that align with your taste.
